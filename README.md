# Examples-of-codes

---

This repository is for simple and educational codes in several different languages. I occasionally upload some code here. Our goal is to learn, let's learn!

---

## The languages with which we have written code so far.

---

### What is C?

> C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.

---

### What is Erlang?

> Erlang is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language, and a garbage-collected runtime system.

---

### What is Rust?

> Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety and speed.
> It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.
> “The Rust Programming Language” is split into three sections, which you can navigate through the menu on the left."

---

### What is Python?
> Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
> Python is free and easy to learn.
